	<description>
		A camera node which automatically positions itself based on XR tracking data.
		In contrast to [XRController3D], the render thread has access to more up-to-date tracking data, and the location of the [XRCamera3D] node can lag a few milliseconds behind what is used for rendering.
		[b]Note:[/b] If [member Viewport.use_xr] is [code]true[/code], most of the camera properties are overridden by the active [XRInterface]. The only properties that can be trusted are the near and far planes.
