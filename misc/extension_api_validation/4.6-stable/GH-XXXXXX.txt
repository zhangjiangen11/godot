# This file should contain expected output of --validate-extension-api when run against the extension_api.json of the 4.6-stable tag.
# Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored.
# They should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.
